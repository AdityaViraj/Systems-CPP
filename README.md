# Systems Programming in C++

Low-level systems programming with **modern C++**, focusing on
**performance, memory safety, and concurrency**.

## 🎯 Goal
Develop production-quality C++ systems skills required for:
- Trading infrastructure
- Distributed systems
- ML platforms
- Performance-critical software

## 🧠 Topics Covered
- Memory management (RAII, smart pointers)
- Stack vs heap behavior
- Cache-friendly data structures
- Multithreading & synchronization
- Atomic operations & memory models
- Linux system interfaces

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **C++17 / C++20**
- **STL & low-level primitives**
- **Linux**
- **CMake**

## 📈 Philosophy
> Correctness first. Performance second. Abstractions last.

Every line is written with **hardware behavior in mind**.

## 🚀 Roadmap
- [ ] Lock-free data structures
- [ ] Custom allocators
- [ ] Event-driven systems
- [ ] Low-latency messaging patterns
